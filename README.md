The Cedra Constant: A novel mathematical constant with remarkable properties

📐 Definition
Cedra = √3 + √2 + 1/√2 - 2 ≈ 1.853371151128520

The Cedra constant is defined as the sum of dimensional signatures representing the geometric structure of spacetime. This mathematical expression encodes fundamental properties that manifest across diverse scientific domains, from quantum mechanics to computational geometry.

Physical Interpretation
Spacetime Quantum Structure
The Cedra constant represents the quantum of spacetime with inherent geometric nature:
Cedra = √3 + √2 + 1/√2 - 2
        3D + 2D + 1D - t

√3: Three-dimensional spatial volume
√2: Two-dimensional surface geometry
1/√2: One-dimensional linear measure
-2: Temporal dimension signature

This structure satisfies the Minkowski spacetime metric ds² = -c²dt² + dx² + dy² + dz², 
providing a mathematical foundation for modeling discrete time in quantum physics.

Planck Scale Connection
The constant exhibits remarkable proximity to fundamental physics:

f_Planck ≈ Cedra × 10⁴³ Hz (99.92% precision)
This correspondence suggests deep connections to quantum gravity and the fundamental frequency of spacetime itself


Mathematical Properties
Golden Ratio Relationship

Through the auxiliary constant Delta:
δ = (1 + √5) / (2√3 + 3√2 - 4) ≈ 0.8730221077
Cedra × δ = φ (exact)

This perfect relationship links Cedra to the golden ratio φ, connecting it to natural harmony and optimal proportions found throughout nature.
Exponential Form and Cycles

The constant can be expressed as:
Cedra ≈ e^(29/47) (99.998% precision)
This form reveals harmonic properties:

29 → 2+9 = 11
47 → 4+7 = 11
Quasi-periodic behavior with period 47
ln(Cedra) × 47 ≈ 29 (fundamental cycle relationship)


⚖️ Chaos and Harmony
The Cedra constant bridges the apparent contradiction between randomness and structure:

Chaos: Generates sequences that pass statistical randomness tests
Harmony: Underlying geometric patterns with period-47 cycles
Balance: "Perfect random but well-structured" behavior

This duality makes it valuable for studying complex systems where deterministic rules produce seemingly random but fundamentally ordered behavior.
